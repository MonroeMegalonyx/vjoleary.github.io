                    <p>The program I have been working with during my AmeriCorps VISTA term, Mentors in the Making, was recognized as “Most Innovative Maker-Centered Learning Program of the Year” by US2020, a program of Citizen Schools.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Most Innovative Maker-Centered Learning Program of the Year award recognizes those who have taken a unique, creative and effective approach to expanding maker-centered learning within their communities by supporting educator professional development, hosting events that engage and celebrate student maker projects and the creation of spaces that foster these experiences. Mentors in the Making, a program from Carnegie Science Center, matches STEM professionals 1:1 with underrepresented high school students for rigorous 6-month projects, applying the latest digital fabrication techniques toward solutions that benefit their community.</p>

                    <p>I am excited to share my first publication in a scientific journal, “Georeferencing for Research Use (GRU): An integrated geospatial training paradigm for biocollections researchers and data providers.” This article came from an idea at an iDigBio workshop on georeferencing collection materials, and describes best practices and topics covered by the workshop so everyone will be able to learn about it.</p>

                    <p>The National Climate Assessment is a collaborative effort by over a dozen government agencies in coordination with the White House to identify and describe the impact of climate change to the nation. I worked in the USGCRP office this past summer through the Truman Scholarship program and was able to be a contributor as the report was finalized for publication. It was a great experience to see how multiple agencies work together on large, comprehensive reports and gave me an appreciation for that process. The report is available as a large PDF, but interestingly it was primarly written as bite sized chapters made available as interactive websites and the authors expect most people to read the report in this format instead of more traditional paper copies.</p>

                    <blockquote>
  <p>The Center for Scholar Development encourages and supports students who seek to expand their horizons and reach for something bigger. We also hope students will reflect on why they do the things they do, about the choices that they make and the things that matter to them. The Fellowships Graduation Award recognizes a graduating Honors Program student who has contributed to this way of thinking and the broader fellowships culture at Drexel.</p>

                    <p>Every year for more than 15 years my fraternity, Phi Kappa Psi, has spent the day before Thanksgiving preparing about 100 home cooked meals for the homeless as well as 911 call center employees. I was lucky enough to be in charge of the event in 2015, and it was one of the highlights of my time in Phi Kappa Psi. This year CBS Philly joined us before 7:00AM to watch how the all the meals come together.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The NOAA Hollings Scholarship is awarded annually to students seeking careers in oceanic and atmospheric science, research, technology and education, in honor of long-time South Carolina Senator Ernest F. Hollings. Hollings served in Congress for 36 years, where he was instrumental in the creation of NOAA and was an advocate in creating legislation designed to protect the world’s oceans.</p>

                    <p>In response to <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2016/04/13/science-fairs-white-house/">Carl Zimmer’s</a> comments to STAT News that science fairs were flawed and an exercise in privilege, I wrote about my experience with these fairs growing up.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My first science fair opened doors for me to do real scientific research. The international fair did much more. It gave me a new goal to shoot for each year. It taught me to ask questions. It showed me that failing is not only OK but is a necessary part of science. Because you have to explain your project to everyone from science teachers and Nobel laureates to the general public, science fairs taught me how to communicate science. One of my favorite parts of science is being able to talk to someone and get them excited about science.
Competing in science fairs also helped me get to the college I attend today, both in getting accepted and in paying for it with some of the awards I won.
It’s impossible to say where I’d be now without science fairs, but those experiences gave me a platform to do research about the environment and introduced me to a new world of questions.</p>

  <p>“The classroom should not be the end of your learning. Whether you go home and read, debate with peers, do research, work online, whatever, you cannot allow yourself to stop learning once school is over. Learning should happen every second of every day and the only thing you need to do to be a scientist or mathematician is to keep asking why, and occasionally writing down the answer so you can get published and get other people to ask why.”</p>

                    <p>The Society for Science and the Public is the organization that supports and organizes many of the science fairs I participated in as a high school student. These programs were my first experience doing research and presenting results. This month I returned with several of my peers as alumni to present an award at the International Science and Engineering Fair in Los Angelos. I spoke to them afterwards about the experience and why we returned.

                    <blockquote>
  <p>I know I speak for all West Virginians in congratulating our native Wheeling student, Vincent O’Leary, on becoming a finalist in one of the most prestigious pre-college science competitions in the country. Vincent Jacob not only contributed his valuable research to the science community, but his drive, discipline and talent demonstrate true leadership skills. I wish Vincent only the best, and I am confident that this impressive achievement will surely lead to many other great accomplishments in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Senator Joe Manchin</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>West Virginia’s students have shown time and time again just how innovative they are. And that innovation, especially in science and related fields, is at the heart of West Virginia’s economic future. Vincent is proof that West Virginia and its students have what it takes to compete on a national level. I know he will make his school, family, and our state proud.</p>

                    <p>I was recently recognized as a finalist for the <a href="http://www.societyforscience.org/STS">Intel Science Talent Search 2013</a> and spoke with West Liberty University about the importance of my mentor, Dr. Zach Loughman. I have been working with Dr. Loughman for years on this science fair project.

<blockquote>
  <p>Any time he needed anything he would email or call, and we would discuss issues he was having. I was completing my Ph.D. at that time, and would call my academic adviser to discuss dissertation issues, hang up the phone, and then get a phone call from Vincent and have the same level conversation with him. Vincent truly works at a different level than most high school students.</p>

                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>I’ve worked for several years on a science fair project exploring the effects of invasive crayfish in West Virginia. In that time I have been awarded over $150,000 in awards and scholarships, and have been lucky enough to travel around the country to compete at the national and internation level. These opportunities were invaluable to prepare me for college and have hands on experience in research. Recently I spoke to the Wheeling Intelligencer about my science fair journey.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m amazed at what he’s done. I noticed there’s been such a growth in him as a student and also as an individual. If you bring up a topic and he’s curious about it, he’ll go as a far as he needs to go to discover the answer to the question. I think he really is inquisitive and willing to take the risk and do the leg work to find out the answers. He’s amazing. He’s a great kid.</p>
