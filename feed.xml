&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Most Innovative Maker-Centered Learning Program of the Year award recognizes those who have taken a unique, creative and effective approach to expanding maker-centered learning within their communities by supporting educator professional development, hosting events that engage and celebrate student maker projects and the creation of spaces that foster these experiences. Mentors in the Making, a program from Carnegie Science Center, matches STEM professionals 1:1 with underrepresented high school students for rigorous 6-month projects, applying the latest digital fabrication techniques toward solutions that benefit their community.&lt;/p&gt;
